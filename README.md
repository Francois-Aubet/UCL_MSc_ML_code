# UCL_MSc_ML_code


The code of my master's project.


In the algorithms folder are all the different algorithms. They share the interface IGPFA that implements all the common function that they have.

In the main repository are many automated testing classes that test and record data on the functioning of the algorithm in different ways.

The code to generate synthetic datasets is in the file generating_G.py .


The main.py file contains the instructions to run the models for a single model fitting. All the parameters can be picked in this file.

In the dataset folder we have put a small synthetic dataset on which the different algorithm can be tried.
